Weather iOS app like UI

This project is built to achive **Weather iOS App** like UI.

It is not exactly like Weather app, but I tried whatever is possible to do!
But I belive that it is possible to achive same UI as Weather app by modifying this project code.

**UI Structure**

It contains collection view with 5 sections containing 2 row each.

First and Second rows are freeze, not available to scroll.

****Developement is in progress...****


**Limitations**

1. Background still/moving image is not possible right now
2. Third row is moving up/down immediatly after starting scroll
3. Fading and hiding tempratur and bottom note in first row is remaining


**Feel free to use this code and improve by pull requests!!!**
